# How to edit: simply change the text inside the quotes following the text: parameter！

# 如何编辑：只需改写text:后面引号里的内容即可

# Variables: The curly braces {mobName}, {resourceName}, etc are variables for the phrase, to print dynamic data on
# screen. For example "You have {amount} villagers", {amount} would be the villager count itself. These must remain
# in the translated version as well, or the actual data will never be displayed.

# 变量：花括号内{敌人名称}、{资源名称}等内容是游戏内短语中的变量，用来显示游戏中的动态数据。比如“你有{amount}个村民”，{amount}
# 就是村民数量的代称。花括号及其中内容必须保持原样，不加任何改动，否则这些数据无法正常显示。

# Currently ONLY SUPPORTED IN DEATH MESSAGES there is a gender variable, for example a line you need to translate may
# say "No one liked (他:她:它) anyway.", the variable inside is always formatting (male:female:none), and the correct 
# gender will be picked based on (obviously) the gender of the mob that died. You can change the contents of the variables 
# in any way you desire, as long as all three are there. You may also add or remove them as needed. Some languages 
# (particularly the romance languages) may require you to change the entire structure of the sentence based on the 
# gender reporting the message. For now, there's a small work around for this. Because you can put anything you want in 
# the variables, you can do something like this; "(No one liked him anyway.:No one liked her anyway.:No one liked them anyway.)"
# and rather than just replacing him, her or them, it'll replace the entire line. This will allow you to restructure the 
# entire sentence depending on what gender has died.

# 目前 **仅在死亡消息中支持** 性别变量，例如你可能翻译到一行这样的文字：“No one liked (他:她:它) anyway.”。这样的变量在其中需保持
# (阳性称呼:阴性称呼:无性称呼) 这样的格式，这样在小人死亡时才能选择正确的性别称呼。对于特定的语言你可以自由编辑三种称呼，以适应语言本身的
# 需求。有些语言（尤其是罗马语系）可能针对不同性别需要改写整个句子，此时你可以借助该变量直接选择整句，如：(没人喜欢他:没人喜欢她:它没人喜欢)
# 利用这个机制你可以在不同性别小人死亡时给出不同的句式结构。

# Colors: If you need to change around the coloring of text, it's fairly simple. Most text by default is white, you need
# to add $COL1 where "COL" is the color code, and 0 through 2 is the brightness. Most text should have brightness set
# to 1. I recommend not changing the color codes used in each line (Although you can, it won't hurt anything), but for
# your language you may have to rearrange them a bit. Remember, changing the color will change all the color following
# that line until another color code is entered. So "My cat is $RED1red, and it's pretty！" will make "red, and it's
# pretty！" all in red. Where as "My cat is $RED1red$WHI0, and it's pretty！" will only set the word "red" to the color RED1.

# 颜色：改变文本颜色十分容易。大多数默认文本颜色是白色,要使用其他颜色，只需在文字前添加$COL1，其中COL是颜色代码，1是文字亮度（可取0~2）
# 大部分文字应该将亮度设为1，个人建议不修改那些文字代码（虽然你可以这么做，这么做并不会有什么影响。），但是你也可以根据语言的实际需要来
# 对它们进行微调。需要注意的是，改变文字颜色将会修改指令之后一整行文字的颜色。比如“我的猫是$RED1红色的，而且很漂亮！”这样写会使得“红色的，
# 而且很漂亮”这些字变为红色，而想要仅将“红色”显示为红色，你需要这样写“我的猫是$RED1红色$WHI0的，而且很漂亮！”

# Valid Color Codes:
# White/Default:  WHI0
# Yellow:         YEL0, YEL1, YEL2
# Red:            RED0, RED1, RED2
# Green:          GRE0, GRE1, GRE2
# Blue:           BLU0, BLU1, BLU2
# Black/Grey:     BLA0, BLA1, BLA2
# Cyan:           CYA0, CYA1, CYA2
# Pink:           PIN0, PIN1, PIN2
# Orange:         ORA0, ORA1, ORA2
# Magenta:        MAG0, MAG1, MAG2

# 可用颜色代码表:
# 白色/默认:  WHI0
# 黄:         YEL0, YEL1, YEL2
# 红:            RED0, RED1, RED2
# 绿:          GRE0, GRE1, GRE2
# 蓝:           BLU0, BLU1, BLU2
# 黑/灰:     BLA0, BLA1, BLA2

# 橙:         ORA0, ORA1, ORA2
# 品:        MAG0, MAG1, MAG2

# Line Breaks: DO NOT EVER HIT ENTER/RETURN TO MAKE LINE BREAKS. To make a line break you must use the tilde (~) key.
# For example; "This is Line 1,~and this is Line 2" will print two lines, with "This is Line 1" on line one, and "and
# this is Line 2." on the second.

# Any time a line is left blank or removed, the game will load the default English version. Although I recommend not
# touching any lines you do not wish to translate.

# If an entry has optional: "true" directly below any text:, you are not required to translate that line. But you
# may if you choose to, it just won't count to reaching 100%.

# You can add forceCount: "true" directly below any text: line to tell the game that line is in fact translated,
# in the rare case no translation is actually required. For example, the word "Bandage" is the same in English and
# French, and thus there's no reason to translate it.
